<br />
The result page has dynamic rounded card rendering with card-like design. Also it's auto downloading data while user scrolling :)

### Filter

FilterView is super bouncy with smooth UIKit custom animation. Drag the top edges to play with it. LOL :)

### Detail

Basically is just a SFSafariViewController instance. I think it's nice if user not just come to search and filter but also can see the detail what they are looking for :)
